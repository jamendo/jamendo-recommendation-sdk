Jamendo Recommendation SDK
--------------------------

The goal of this project is to start a community effort to improve music recommendations on Jamendo.

We want to provide all the tools and test datasets so that everyone can develop, test and submit their own algorithms.


Datasets
--------

We try to have a common format for all the datasets but it's not a strong requirement.

Currently it's : [User ID];[Item ID];[Rating];[Weight];[Date]

 - jamendoalbumreviews : Ratings of the albums by the users. All weights currently equal 0.5 but we could take into account some kind of "karma" for the users.

 - jamendoalbumstarred : Albums added to favourites of users ("stars"). Rating=Weight=1 ; We'll add the Date field on request.
 						This dataset currently doesn't work with the rest of the SDK and needs some love. 
 
These two should be enough to get some algorithms started but feel free to ask us for more!


Algorithms
----------

We've included a couple of simple ones to showcase the SDK. You should obviously be able to do better, of to tune the SVD implementation
that seems to yield good results.


Methodology
-----------

Currently we're inspired by the Netflix Challenge, and use RMSE to compare algorithms. You may add others measures of course.

To test an algorithm, use the test_rmse.py command :

	python test_rmse.py [dataset] [algorithm]

You can also use "all" to compare them (defined in test_rmse.py)

	python test_rmse jamendoalbumreviews all
